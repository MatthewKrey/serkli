        Overall, white women are slightly more likely to develop breast cancer than are African-American women,
        but African-American women are more likely to die of this cancer.
        However, in women under 45 years of age, breast cancer is more common in African- American women. 
        Asian, Hispanic, and Native-American women have a lower risk of developing and dying from breast cancer. 

        Having one immediate relative approximately doubles a womans risk

        Having 2 first-degree relatives increases her risk about 3-fold

        Women who have 2 to 5 drinks daily have about 1.5 times the risk of women who donâ€™t drink alcohol

        Altogether, less than 15% of women with breast cancer have a family member with this disease
        This means that most (over 85%) women who get breast cancer do not have a family history of this disease

        5% to 10% of breast cancer cases are thought to be hereditary

        2 of 3 invasive breast cancers are found in women age 55 or older

        Brisk walking reduced a woman's risk by 18%
